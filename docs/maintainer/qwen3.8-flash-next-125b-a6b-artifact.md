# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next 125B-A6B artifact reference

This reference defines the sole registered storage profile for Qwen3.8 Flash-Next 125B-A6B. Generic
framing, layouts, and numeric formats remain governed by `artifact-container.md`,
`storage-layouts.md`, and `tensor-formats.md`; model mathematics are defined in
[`qwen3.8-flash-next-125b-a6b-model.md`](qwen3.8-flash-next-125b-a6b-model.md).

## Architecture and representation

The v3 Text component selects `Qwen3_8FlashNextForCausalLM` with
`model_type=qwen3_8_flash_next_text`, hidden size 2560, 48 layers, vocabulary 248320 and 512 experts.
The package validates this fixed configuration and the selected logical bindings. `metadata.name`
is descriptive; filenames and former v2 `model_id`/`weights_id` fields do not select execution.
The full recipe emits Text, MTP, Vision, the indexed proposal head and six frontend resources.
Only enabled components and their dependencies are bound and materialized.

## Inventory and formats

The closed inventory contains 1,627 tensors and six raw resources. Main routed expert banks use
`nvfp4` with `expert_block_scale_k16_m128x4_v1`; their FP32 input divisors are per-expert `activation_divisor` auxiliaries on the
`AllowA4` Use. Other projections consume A16 and require a declared activation policy. MTP expert banks, projections, HyperConnection weights, norms, embeddings, output head,
and shared experts retain BF16. GDN control vectors and NVFP4 divisors use FP32. Vision retains the
existing Q4/Q5/Q6 groupwise and W8 merger profiles.

The 320,001,536-by-160 PLE embedding is one contiguous FP8 E4M3FN tensor plus a BF16 multiplier.
It is the artifact's only file-mapped tensor. The reader validates its descriptor and payload
extent, then exposes read-only mappings spanning the v3 payload shards. A gathered row may cross a shard boundary. Demand paging and the operating-system file
cache own residency; the generic materializer does not allocate host or device storage for the
complete 51.2 GB table. Prompt preparation gathers only the sixteen rows selected for each token.

The upgraded artifact occupies 134,755,956,216 bytes across five files capped at 32 GB each. Its format allocation is 1,249 BF16, 168 FP32,
one FP8 table, 96 NVFP4 expert banks, 55 Q4, 54 Q5, one Q6, one INT32 map, and two Q8 tensors. The six embedded
resources are `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `chat_template.jinja`,
`generation_config.json`, `preprocessor_config.json`, and `video_preprocessor_config.json` under
the `frontend/` namespace.

## Conversion

The converter accepts only the closed `RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` checkpoint allocation.
It preserves BF16 and FP8 words, transposes channel-wise convolution kernels into the target layout,
and rearranges ModelOpt expert-major NVFP4 codes and scales into NInfer's bank layout without
dequantizing or requantizing them. It concatenates the 128 PLE shards directly into the one table
payload and writes a conversion report beside the artifact.

```bash
python3 -m tools.convert.qwen3_8_flash_next_125b_a6b.convert \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 \
  --out out/qwen3_8_flash_next_125b_a6b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --device cuda
```

The output basename is fixed. Conversion rejects missing, unexpected, incorrectly shaped, or
incorrectly typed source tensors, mismatched paired gate/up scales, invalid divisors, incompatible
model configuration, and incomplete frontend resources.

## Upgrade an existing v2 artifact

```bash
python3 tools/upgrade_ninfer_v2_to_v3.py \
  out/candidate-wide-q4/qwen3_8_flash_next_125b_a6b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  out/v3/qwen3_8_flash_next_125b_a6b_nvfp4.ninfer
```

The one-time upgrader preserves all encoded weight bytes and Flash-Next's registered chat template.
It writes v3 components, logical bindings, Uses and shard framing. Keep the entry file and all
`.part-NNNN` companions together. The original v2 file remains available to the previous binary;
the v3 Engine accepts only v3 artifacts.

## Runtime binding

Text alone selects 1,260 device objects. MTP adds 31, Vision adds 333, and the optimized proposal
adds two. Frontend resources are owned host bytes; PLE is a read-only mapped range whose lifetime
is owned by the loaded model. PLE mappings are not counted as GPU uploads or materializer staging.
The C++ loader checks logical shapes, formats, expert layout, activation permissions, selected
component targets and indexed-proposal geometry before building the Program.

Flash-Next retains its registered template renderer and does not support `--chat-template`
overrides. Text, Vision, MTP, prefix reuse and concurrency still use the public Engine route.
